            <p class="first-section">Islam always teaches brotherhood. One of the acts of worship in Islam is to come
                forward to help the poor and poor people. If the one whom Allah has given wealth helps the needy people
                from that wealth, Allah is pleased with it.</p>

                    Among the basic human rights, we value their food first. Many people are living on just one meal at

                    globe, schooling does not lead to learning.So some of your donations can make a child an educated
